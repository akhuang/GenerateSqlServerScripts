GenerateSqlServerScripts
========================

Auto generate sql server scripts, you don't need open sql 2008 management studio.

In sql server 2008, you must open management studio, and then select a database, select task -> generate scrits on 
right context... when the dialog show, you must do some settings to meet you need. It's so boring.

You can use this tool easier.

1. modify the database connection
2. update the table name which you want to script data
3. script schema or script data only  or script all in app.config

that's all, have fun.
